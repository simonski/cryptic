# 1.0.0

Before I can release on @master and @1.0.0 I need to

- investigate overall binary size (5MB - can it be smaller?)
- github actions from crosscompiling
- setup dependency on goutils as formal - version goutils as github.com/simonski/goutils@1.0.0
- review unit tests/coverage
- verify minimum go compatible version
- verify initial setup - mac
- verify initial setup - win
- verify initial setup - linux
- "help" on all function calls
- investigate reading secrets or writing secrets from stdin as password characters
- "init", "verify", "setup" steps to be described and completed
- `cryptic verify` ssh public key verification/generation
